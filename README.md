# Compiler from Scratch

A compiler for a subset of C programming language is made from scratch using flex and bison.

This repository contains the following files:

- `symbolTable.cpp`– Implements the construction and management of the symbol table.
- `lexical_analysis.cpp`– Performs lexical analysis of the input source code.
- `syntax_semantic_code_gen.y`– Performs syntax and semantic analysis, and generates intermediate code targeting 8086 Assembly.
